# Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This is a collection of Machine Learning algorithms which I have implemented **from scratch** using only **NumPy**.  
I am starting this project to further deepen my understanding of these algorithms.

## Goals for this Project

- Learning and building some of the core ML algorithms from scratch  
- Understanding the math and intuition behind each algorithm  
- Evaluating models on real-world datasets and comparing performance with standard implementations (e.g. scikit-learn)
